# Rationale

- **Choice**: `<an APEX integer type>` -> `APEX_LONG_INTEGER`
  **Reason**: These placeholders are only used for `*_ID_TYPE`. All of these IDs are only ever
  handed out by the OS. By picking the largest possible type available (64-bit integer), we ensure
  that we are compatible with any possible OS, as we can store any possible ID. For an OS that
  chooses a 32-bit integer, the upper bits just remain untouched.
- **Choice**: import the linear memory (via `--import-memory` linker flag)
  **Reason**: Each partition has multiple processes, which are guaranteed to have a shared address space (ARINC 653 P1-5 chapter 2.3.2). The only way to achieve this is if they have shared linear memory. To cause that, they all need to import the linear memory.
- **Choice**: export the function table (via `--export-table` linker flag)
  **Reason**: In order for the `CREATE_PROCESS` call to succeed, the host environment needs to be able to call a guest environment function identified via an index into said table. Exporting the table ensures that the funcref table is accessible from the host environment.
- **Choice**: Do not use `__externref_t` for function pointers, e.g. the `ENTRY_POINT` argument in the `CREATE_ERROR_HANDLER` function.
  **Reason**: `__externref_t` is not representable in Linear Memory. Hence, it can not become the field of a struct. However, the `PROCESS_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE` struct comprises an `ENTRY_POINT` field holding a function pointer. As `__externref_t` can not be used there, it is necessary to expose the table for function pointers. Therefore, any use of `__externref_t` shall be avoided, in order to keep all function pointer representations consistent.
